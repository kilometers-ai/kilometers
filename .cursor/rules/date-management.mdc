## Date Management & Time Reference System

### Current Date Context
**Today**: Friday, June 27, 2025
**Current Quarter**: Q2 2025
**Current Year**: 2025

### Date Reference Guidelines

#### 1. Always Use Current Date Context
When writing or updating documentation, always reference the current date above. This ensures:
- Roadmap items are realistically dated
- "Coming soon" references are accurate
- Example timestamps reflect recent dates
- Project timelines are current

#### 2. Documentation Date Patterns

**Example Timestamps**: Use recent dates, not old 2024 examples
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good - Recent examples
"timestamp": "2025-06-27T10:30:45Z"
"created": "2025-06-26T14:22:15Z"

# ‚ùå Bad - Outdated examples  
"timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45Z"
```

**Roadmap References**: Update based on current quarter
```markdown
# ‚úÖ Current roadmap (we're in Q2 2025)
- Q3 2025: Dashboard application and user authentication
- Q4 2025: Advanced analytics and ML-powered insights
- Q1 2026: Enterprise SSO and multi-tenant features

# ‚ùå Outdated roadmap
- Q1 2025: Dashboard application (this quarter has passed)
```

#### 3. CLI Commands for Date References

When needing current date information, use these commands:
```bash
# Get current date in ISO format
date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"

# Get current quarter info
date +"%Y Q$((($(date +%-m)-1)/3+1))"

# Get relative dates for examples
date -u -d "1 day ago" +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"
date -u -d "1 week ago" +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"
```

#### 4. Automatic Date Validation

When updating documentation, always check for:
- [ ] Outdated quarter references (Q1-Q4 with past years)
- [ ] Example timestamps from previous years
- [ ] "Coming soon" items with past dates
- [ ] Roadmap items that should have moved to "Completed"

#### 5. Project-Specific Date Rules

**Kilometers.ai Timeline Context:**
- **Q4 2024**: Core technical foundation completed
- **Q1 2025**: CI/CD and marketing site completed  
- **Q2 2025** (Current): Production ready, market validation phase
- **Q3 2025**: Planned dashboard development
- **Q4 2025**: Advanced analytics and enterprise features

**Status Updates:**
- Items marked "Q1 2025" that aren't done ‚Üí Move to "Q3 2025" 
- Items completed ‚Üí Mark as "‚úÖ Completed Q1/Q2 2025"
- Current work ‚Üí Mark as "üöß In Progress Q2 2025"

#### 6. Memory Bank Date Updates

When updating memory bank files, include current date context:
```markdown
*Last Updated: June 27, 2025 - During production deployment phase*
*Next Update: After Q3 2025 dashboard completion*
```

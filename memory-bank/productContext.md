# Product Context: Kilometers.ai

## Problem Statement

### Core Problem
AI agents are becoming integral to developer workflows, but organizations have **zero visibility** into:
- What tools their AI is accessing
- How much these interactions cost
- Whether sensitive data is being exposed
- Performance patterns and bottlenecks
- Compliance and audit trails

### Pain Points
1. **Cost Blindness**: Teams don't know how much their AI usage costs until the bill arrives
2. **Security Gaps**: No monitoring of what data AI agents access or share
3. **Performance Issues**: Can't identify slow or failing MCP interactions
4. **Compliance Concerns**: No audit trail for AI tool usage
5. **Resource Planning**: Can't predict or budget for AI infrastructure needs

## Solution Overview

### The "Digital Odometer" Approach
Just as cars have odometers to track distance, Kilometers.ai provides an "odometer" for AI agents, tracking every interaction across all tools and services.

### How It Works
```
[AI Tool (Cursor/Claude)] 
    ↓ MCP Protocol
[km CLI Wrapper] ← Transparent monitoring layer
    ↓ 
[Original MCP Server (GitHub/Slack/etc.)]
    ↓ Events
[Kilometers.ai Dashboard] ← Real-time insights
```

### Key Features

#### 1. Transparent Monitoring
- Zero configuration changes to existing setups
- Works with any MCP server (GitHub, Slack, databases, etc.)
- No performance impact on AI workflows

#### 2. Cost Tracking
- Real-time cost estimation per interaction
- Usage patterns and trend analysis
- Budget alerts and forecasting
- Team/project cost allocation

#### 3. Security & Risk Detection
- Identify unusual access patterns
- Flag potential data exposure
- Monitor for credential usage
- Compliance audit trails

#### 4. Performance Insights
- Response time tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Throughput analysis
- Bottleneck identification

## User Experience Goals

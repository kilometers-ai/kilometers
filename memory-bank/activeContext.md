# Active Context: Kilometers.ai

## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: PRODUCTION DEPLOYED AND OPERATIONAL ✅
**MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH COMPLETE!** The complete Kilometers.ai infrastructure is now production-ready and fully operational. DNS configuration issues have been resolved, orphaned resources cleaned up, and the entire system is running cost-optimized in Azure.

### Current Priority: LAUNCH READY - Customer Acquisition Phase
With the complete technical stack deployed and operational, the project has successfully transitioned from development to production-ready status. All infrastructure is clean, monitoring is in place, and the system is ready for customer acquisition and market validation.

## Recent Major Achievements (June 27, 2025)

### ✅ DNS Configuration Crisis RESOLVED
**Critical Issue**: Initial deployment failed due to Azure Static Web Apps DNS validation conflicts
- **Root Cause**: Trying to use CNAME validation for apex domains (kilometers.ai) which conflicts with existing NS/SOA/MX records
- **Solution Implemented**: Domain classification logic to use `dns-txt-token` validation for apex domains and `cname-delegation` for subdomains
- **Result**: Both `kilometers.ai` and `www.kilometers.ai` successfully configured and working

### ✅ Orphaned Resources CLEANED UP  
**Critical Issue**: Resources with suffix `793b144a` existed in Azure but not in Terraform state, wasting ~$18-28/month
- **Root Cause**: Previous Terraform state reset caused new `random_id.suffix` generation while leaving old resources orphaned
- **Resources Removed**: 
  - Static Web App (`stapp-kilometers-marketing-dev-793b144a`)
  - Application Insights (`ai-kilometers-dev-793b144a`) 
  - App Service Plan (`asp-kilometers-dev-793b144a`)
  - Storage Account (`stkilometersdev793b144a`)
  - Log Analytics Workspace (`managed-ai-kilometers-dev-793b144a-ws`)
- **Result**: Infrastructure is now clean and cost-optimized

### ✅ COMPLETE INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT
**Achievement**: Full end-to-end system successfully deployed and verified operational
- **Current Resource Suffix**: `80aa4338` (actively managed by Terraform)
- **All Services Operational**: API, database, marketing site, CLI distribution, DNS
- **Custom Domains Working**: `kilometers.ai` → Static Web App, `api.dev.kilometers.ai` → API
- **Cost Optimized**: Only necessary resources running, estimated monthly cost properly managed

## Next Steps (Market Validation Phase)

### Immediate Actions Available
1. **Customer Acquisition**
   - Marketing site is live and optimized
   - CLI installation working (`curl -sSL https://get.kilometers.ai | sh`)
   - Complete onboarding flow functional
   - Analytics and monitoring in place

2. **Market Validation**
   - A/B testing different value propositions
   - Collecting user feedback and usage patterns
   - Optimizing conversion funnel based on real data
   - Iterating on pricing and feature set

### Technical Readiness Verified ✅
- **API Health**: `https://app-kilometers-api-dev-80aa4338.azurewebsites.net/health` ✅
- **Marketing Site**: `https://kilometers.ai` ✅  
- **CLI Distribution**: `https://get.kilometers.ai` ✅
- **Dashboard URL**: `https://app.kilometers.ai` (configured for future)
- **Monitoring**: Application Insights fully configured ✅

*Next Update: After first customer acquisition milestones*

## Current System Capabilities (PRODUCTION READY)

### Complete Marketing-to-Product Flow ✅
- **Marketing Site**: Professional Next.js 15 site with Tailwind CSS on `kilometers.ai`
- **OAuth Integration**: Split authentication flow (marketing initiates, app completes)
- **30-Second Setup**: Single command CLI installation working globally
- **Custom Domains**: All domains properly configured with SSL certificates
- **Automated Deployment**: GitHub Actions CI/CD for all components

### CLI Features (FULLY OPERATIONAL) ✅

- **Event Capture**: All JSON-RPC communication logged and analyzed
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows, macOS (Intel/ARM), Linux binaries available
- **API Integration**: Events sent to Azure backend for processing
- **Offline Resilience**: Local buffering when API temporarily unavailable

### API Backend (PRODUCTION DEPLOYED) ✅
- **Event Processing**: High-throughput ingestion and storage
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Event sourcing with time-series optimization
- **Analytics Engine**: Real-time cost tracking and usage patterns
- **Security**: Azure Key Vault integration, encrypted connections
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks and Application Insights

### Infrastructure (CLEAN AND OPTIMIZED) ✅
- **Azure Services**: App Service, PostgreSQL, Static Web Apps, Key Vault, Application Insights
- **Terraform Managed**: All infrastructure properly tracked in state
- **Cost Optimized**: Orphaned resources removed, only necessary services running
- **DNS Configured**: Apex and subdomain validation working correctly
- **Monitoring**: Full Application Insights telemetry and alerting

## Critical Operational Knowledge (LEARNED IN PRODUCTION)

### DNS Configuration for Static Web Apps
**Key Pattern**: Azure Static Web Apps requires different validation methods for different domain types
```terraform
# Apex domains (e.g., kilometers.ai) must use dns-txt-token validation
resource "azurerm_static_web_app_custom_domain" "apex_domains" {
  validation_type = "dns-txt-token"  # Required for apex
}

# Subdomains (e.g., www.kilometers.ai) can use cname-delegation
resource "azurerm_static_web_app_custom_domain" "subdomain_domains" {
  validation_type = "cname-delegation"  # Works for subdomains
}
```

### Resource Cleanup Patterns
**Orphaned Resource Detection**: When `random_id.suffix` changes, resources with old suffix become orphaned
```bash
# Detect orphaned resources
az resource list --query "[?contains(name, 'OLD_SUFFIX')]" --output table

# Safe deletion order (respecting dependencies)
# 1. Static Web Apps (no dependencies)
# 2. Application Insights (no dependencies)  
# 3. App Service Plans (no web apps using them)
# 4. Storage Accounts (no services using them)
# 5. Log Analytics Workspaces (managed resources, delete last)
```

### Terraform State Consistency (CRITICAL)
**Golden Rule**: Always verify state consistency before major infrastructure changes
```bash
# Essential workflow for any infrastructure changes
terraform refresh -var-file=config/dev.tfvars  # Sync state with reality
terraform plan -var-file=config/dev.tfvars     # Verify expected changes
terraform apply -var-file=config/dev.tfvars    # Apply changes
```

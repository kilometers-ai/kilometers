# Active Context: Kilometers.ai

## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: Production Deployment Ready ✅
**BREAKTHROUGH COMPLETE!** The entire core system is implemented and functional. We have successfully built a transparent MCP monitoring system that captures events end-to-end from CLI to API to database storage.

### Current Priority: Documentation and Launch Preparation
With the core functionality and infrastructure complete, we're now in the final phase - comprehensive documentation and demo creation for user onboarding.

## Recent Changes

### ✅ Completed Major Milestones
- **Complete CLI Implementation**: Fully functional Go CLI wrapper with transparent MCP server monitoring

- **Complete Infrastructure**: Production-ready Terraform configuration for Azure deployment
- **Complete CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment
- **Complete Operations**: Comprehensive monitoring, backup, and disaster recovery procedures

### ✅ Verified Working Features
- **Transparent MCP Wrapping**: CLI successfully wraps any MCP server without interference
- **Event Capture**: Both requests and responses captured with full JSON parsing
- **API Communication**: CLI sends events to API with configurable batching and retry logic
- **Data Storage**: Events stored with PostgreSQL integration and in-memory fallback
- **Event Retrieval**: Activity feed and statistics endpoints fully functional
- **Cost & Risk Analysis**: Basic cost estimation ($0.001/KB) and risk scoring implemented
- **Health Monitoring**: Complete health check endpoints for production monitoring

### ✅ Production Infrastructure Ready
- **Azure Resources**: Complete Terraform definitions for all required Azure services
- **Database Schema**: EF Core migrations ready for PostgreSQL deployment
- **Security**: Key Vault integration, managed identity, and proper access policies
- **Monitoring**: Application Insights integration for production telemetry
- **Deployment**: Automated scripts for complete infrastructure and application deployment

## Active Decisions & Architecture

### Core Architecture Confirmed

2. **Event Sourcing**: All interactions captured as immutable events for analysis
3. **Hexagonal Architecture**: Clean separation of domain, infrastructure, and API concerns
4. **Cloud-Native**: Azure-hosted with PostgreSQL, App Service, and managed identity

### Technical Implementation Complete
1. **CLI Event Handling**: Efficient stdin/stdout monitoring with JSON-RPC parsing
2. **API Authentication**: Bearer token support with environment variable configuration  
3. **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL with automatic migrations and connection resilience
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when API unavailable, local logging fallback

### Configuration & Deployment
1. **CLI Configuration**: Environment variables and config file support
2. **Cross-Platform Distribution**: Multi-platform builds via GitHub Actions
3. **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete Terraform automation for Azure deployment
4. **Production Monitoring**: Health checks, Application Insights, and logging

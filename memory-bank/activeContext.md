# Active Context: Kilometers.ai

## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: CI/CD Implemented ✅
**BREAKTHROUGH COMPLETE!** A full suite of component-based CI/CD pipelines has been implemented using GitHub Actions. The project now has separate, automated workflows for the API, the infrastructure (Terraform), and the CLI tool. This automates the entire deployment process, triggered by pushes to the `main` branch.

### Current Priority: Infrastructure Enhancement & Launch Preparation
With the core technical infrastructure, marketing site, and deployment automation complete, the immediate priority is enhancing the Terraform infrastructure to support marketing site deployment. Following this, the focus shifts to go-to-market activities and customer acquisition.

## Recent Changes

### ✅ Completed Major Milestones
- **Implemented Component-Based CI/CD**: Created three separate GitHub Actions workflows for the API, infrastructure, and CLI.
- **Automated API Deployment**: The `.github/workflows/deploy-api.yml` workflow automatically builds and deploys the .NET API to the Azure App Service on changes to the `api/` directory.
- **Automated Infrastructure Deployment**: The `.github/workflows/deploy-infra.yml` workflow automatically runs `terraform plan` and `apply` on changes to the `terraform/` directory.
- **Automated CLI Release**: The `.github/workflows/deploy-cli.yml` workflow automatically builds the Go CLI for multiple platforms and creates a GitHub Release with the binaries on changes to the `cli/` directory.
- **Marketing Site Integration**: Migrated complete Next.js marketing site into `/marketing/` directory with all configurations and CI/CD workflow.
- **Memory Bank Updated**: Integrated marketing site architecture patterns, environment variables, and infrastructure requirements into primary memory bank.
- **Removed Manual Friction**: The development deployment process is now fully automated, removing the need for manual approvals.

## Next Steps (Go-to-Market)

### Immediate (This Session)
1.  **Finalize Git Repository**
   - Push all new workflow files to the `main` branch to activate the pipelines.
2.  **Update Documentation**
   - Ensure `README.md` files reflect the new automated deployment process.
   - Update `progress.md` to mark CI/CD as complete.

### Immediate Priority (This Week)
1. **Enhance Terraform Infrastructure**
   - Create Azure Static Web Apps module for marketing site hosting
   - Provision GitHub Actions service principal with appropriate roles
   - Configure custom domain (kilometers.ai) and SSL certificate management
   - Set up environment variable management for 14 marketing feature flags

### Short Term (Next Week)
1. **Deploy Marketing Infrastructure**
   - Apply enhanced Terraform configuration to provision marketing resources
   - Configure GitHub repository secrets for Azure Static Web Apps deployment
   - Test end-to-end deployment pipeline for marketing site
2. **Execute Launch Plan**
   - Deploy marketing site to production with custom domain
   - Test complete visitor-to-customer OAuth flow
   - Begin outreach to initial target users
3. **Monitor Initial Usage**
   - Use Azure Application Insights to monitor both marketing and API performance
   - Track conversion funnel from marketing site to authenticated users
   - Gather feedback from the first cohort of users

## Critical Operational Rules

### Terraform Command Best Practices
**ALWAYS specify `-var-file=config/dev.tfvars` (or appropriate environment) with ALL terraform commands.**

❌ **Never run**: `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`, `terraform import`  
✅ **Always run**: `terraform plan -var-file=config/dev.tfvars`, `terraform apply -var-file=config/dev.tfvars`

**Rationale**: Ensures consistent configuration and prevents state/plan mismatches.

### Background Task Workflow
When a user moves a long-running terminal command to the background, I will pause all further actions. I will output a message stating that I am waiting for the user to provide the terminal output or signal that the task is complete before I proceed.

**Example message**: "The deployment is running in the background. I'll wait for you to provide the output once it's complete."

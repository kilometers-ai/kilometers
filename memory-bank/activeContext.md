# Active Context: Kilometers.ai

## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: Marketing Site Deployed ✅
**BREAKTHROUGH COMPLETE!** Azure Static Web Apps infrastructure has been successfully deployed with automated CI/CD pipeline. The marketing site is now live with clean dependency management and all feature flags configured.

### Current Priority: Custom Domain Configuration & Launch
With the marketing site infrastructure deployed and functional, the immediate priority is configuring the custom domain (kilometers.ai) for both the marketing site and API services. Following this, the project will be fully launch-ready for customer acquisition.

## Recent Changes

### ✅ Completed Major Milestones
- **Azure Static Web Apps Deployed**: Complete Terraform module created and provisioned
- **Marketing Site Live**: https://kind-meadow-0cc78e710.1.azurestaticapps.net
- **Clean Dependency Management**: Resolved conflicting dependencies (date-fns, react-day-picker) by removing unused packages
- **GitHub Actions Pipeline**: Automated deployment workflow functional for marketing site
- **Feature Flag System**: All 14 environment variables configured and deployed
- **State Management Lesson**: Learned critical Terraform state consistency patterns
- **Targeted Deployment**: Successfully used terraform targeted apply to avoid infrastructure disruption

### ✅ Infrastructure Enhancement Complete
- **Static Web App Module**: `terraform/modules/static_web_app/` with full configuration
- **API Token Management**: `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN` auto-generated and configured
- **Environment Variables**: 14 marketing feature flags stored as GitHub secrets
- **Build Pipeline**: Next.js static export optimized for Azure deployment
- **Clean Architecture**: Removed unused UI components and dependencies

## Next Steps (Domain & Launch)

### Immediate Priority (Next Session)
1. **Custom Domain Configuration**
   - Configure kilometers.ai CNAME for Azure Static Web Apps
   - Set up app.kilometers.ai subdomain for API services
   - Configure SSL certificates and DNS validation
   - Test end-to-end domain functionality

### Short Term (This Week)
1. **Production Deployment**
   - Deploy marketing site to production environment
   - Configure production feature flags
   - Test complete OAuth flow from custom domain
2. **Launch Preparation**
   - Verify all monitoring and analytics
   - Test visitor-to-customer conversion funnel
   - Prepare for initial user acquisition

## Critical Operational Rules

### Terraform State Management (CRITICAL LESSON LEARNED)
**The #1 cause of infrastructure chaos is Terraform state inconsistency.**

#### State Consistency Rules:
1. **Always verify state sync before major changes**: `terraform refresh -var-file=config/dev.tfvars`
2. **Use targeted applies for new resources**: `terraform apply -target=module.new_resource`
3. **Never delete random_id.suffix without replacement plan**
4. **Import existing resources when state is out of sync**: `terraform import -var-file=config/dev.tfvars`
5. **Check Azure reality vs. state when plans show unexpected recreations**

#### Terraform Command Best Practices:
**ALWAYS specify `-var-file=config/dev.tfvars` (or appropriate environment) with ALL terraform commands.**

❌ **Never run**: `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`, `terraform import`  
✅ **Always run**: `terraform plan -var-file=config/dev.tfvars`, `terraform apply -var-file=config/dev.tfvars`

### Marketing Site Deployment Rules
1. **Dependency Management**: Keep package.json clean - remove unused dependencies immediately
2. **Feature Flags**: Use environment variables for all configuration
3. **Build Optimization**: Use `npm run build:azure` for static export
4. **Path Filtering**: GitHub Actions only triggers on `marketing/**` changes

### Background Task Workflow
When a user moves a long-running terminal command to the background, I will pause all further actions. I will output a message stating that I am waiting for the user to provide the terminal output or signal that the task is complete before I proceed.

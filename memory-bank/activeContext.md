# Active Context: Kilometers.ai

## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: CI/CD Implemented ✅
**BREAKTHROUGH COMPLETE!** A full suite of component-based CI/CD pipelines has been implemented using GitHub Actions. The project now has separate, automated workflows for the API, the infrastructure (Terraform), and the CLI tool. This automates the entire deployment process, triggered by pushes to the `main` branch.

### Current Priority: Market Validation & Customer Acquisition
With the core technical infrastructure and deployment automation complete, the focus now shifts to go-to-market activities. The next critical step is to execute the launch plan, attract the first users, and validate the product's value proposition.

## Recent Changes

### ✅ Completed Major Milestones
- **Implemented Component-Based CI/CD**: Created three separate GitHub Actions workflows for the API, infrastructure, and CLI.
- **Automated API Deployment**: The `.github/workflows/deploy-api.yml` workflow automatically builds and deploys the .NET API to the Azure App Service on changes to the `api/` directory.
- **Automated Infrastructure Deployment**: The `.github/workflows/deploy-infra.yml` workflow automatically runs `terraform plan` and `apply` on changes to the `terraform/` directory.
- **Automated CLI Release**: The `.github/workflows/deploy-cli.yml` workflow automatically builds the Go CLI for multiple platforms and creates a GitHub Release with the binaries on changes to the `cli/` directory.
- **Removed Manual Friction**: The development deployment process is now fully automated, removing the need for manual approvals.

## Next Steps (Go-to-Market)

### Immediate (This Session)
1.  **Finalize Git Repository**
   - Push all new workflow files to the `main` branch to activate the pipelines.
2.  **Update Documentation**
   - Ensure `README.md` files reflect the new automated deployment process.
   - Update `progress.md` to mark CI/CD as complete.

### Short Term (Next Week)
1.  **Execute Launch Plan**
   - Announce the availability of Kilometers.ai on relevant channels.
   - Begin outreach to initial target users.
2.  **Monitor Initial Usage**
   - Use the Kilometers.ai dashboard and Azure Application Insights to monitor system health and user activity.
   - Gather feedback from the first cohort of users.

## Critical Operational Rules

### Terraform Command Best Practices
**ALWAYS specify `-var-file=config/dev.tfvars` (or appropriate environment) with ALL terraform commands.**

❌ **Never run**: `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`, `terraform import`  
✅ **Always run**: `terraform plan -var-file=config/dev.tfvars`, `terraform apply -var-file=config/dev.tfvars`

**Rationale**: Ensures consistent configuration and prevents state/plan mismatches.

### Background Task Workflow
When a user moves a long-running terminal command to the background, I will pause all further actions. I will output a message stating that I am waiting for the user to provide the terminal output or signal that the task is complete before I proceed.

**Example message**: "The deployment is running in the background. I'll wait for you to provide the output once it's complete."

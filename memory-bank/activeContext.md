## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: Production Infrastructure Deployed ✅
**BREAKTHROUGH COMPLETE!** After a lengthy and complex troubleshooting session, the complete Azure infrastructure for the `dev` environment has been successfully deployed and verified using Terraform. The API is confirmed to be healthy and responding to requests.

### Current Priority: Implement CI/CD Pipeline
With the `dev` environment stable and the deployment process battle-tested, the next critical step is to automate the entire workflow. The priority is to build a robust CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that can reliably build, test, and deploy both the infrastructure and the application.

## Recent Changes

### ✅ Completed Major Milestones
- **End-to-End Dev Environment Deployment**: Successfully deployed all Azure resources, including the App Service, PostgreSQL database, Key Vault, and networking, using Terraform.
- **Resolved Complex State Issues**: Navigated and fixed multiple Terraform state conflicts, including `Resource already managed` and `RoleAssignmentExists` errors by using `terraform state rm` and `terraform import`.
- **Fixed Critical Networking Bugs**: Diagnosed and resolved VNet delegation errors (`Microsoft.Web/serverFarms`) and disabled public network access on the App Service.
- **Application Code Deployed**: Manually built, packaged, and deployed the .NET API application to the App Service, resolving a `404 Not Found` error on the health check endpoint.
- **Deployment Verified**: Confirmed with `curl` that the `/health` endpoint returns a `200 OK` status, proving the infrastructure and application are working together correctly.

## Active Decisions & Architecture

### Deployment Strategy Confirmed
1. **Terraform First**: The infrastructure is deployed and stabilized manually via Terraform from the local machine *before* CI/CD is implemented.
2. **Manual Application Deployment (Bootstrap)**: For the initial setup, the application code is manually published and deployed using `dotnet publish` and `az webapp deployment source config-zip`. This will be replaced by the CI/CD pipeline.
3. **RBAC Bootstrapping**: For resources with "chicken-and-egg" RBAC problems (like Key Vault), the initial role assignment is created manually via the Azure CLI (`az role assignment create`) and then imported into the Terraform state.

## Next Steps (CI/CD)

### Immediate (This Session)
1. **Finalize Git Repository**
   - Ensure all `.gitignore` files are correct and no sensitive data is tracked.
   - Commit all changes from the successful deployment.
2. **Develop CI/CD Plan**
   - Outline the steps for building a GitHub Actions workflow.
   - Define stages for build, test, infrastructure deploy (plan & apply), and application deploy.

### Short Term (Next Week)
1. **Implement GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Create the `.github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml` file.
   - Configure secrets for Azure credentials.
   - Build and test the pipeline for the `dev` environment.
2. **Test End-to-End Automation**
   - Push a small code change to trigger the workflow.
   - Verify that the infrastructure and application deploy automatically without manual intervention.

## Critical Operational Rules

### Terraform Command Best Practices
**ALWAYS specify `-var-file=config/dev.tfvars` (or appropriate environment) with ALL terraform commands.**

❌ **Never run**: `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`, `terraform import`  
✅ **Always run**: `terraform plan -var-file=config/dev.tfvars`, `terraform apply -var-file=config/dev.tfvars`

**Rationale**: Ensures consistent configuration and prevents state/plan mismatches.

### Background Task Workflow
When a user moves a long-running terminal command to the background, I will pause all further actions. I will output a message stating that I am waiting for the user to provide the terminal output or signal that the task is complete before I proceed.

**Example message**: "The deployment is running in the background. I'll wait for you to provide the output once it's complete."

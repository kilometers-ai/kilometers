# Progress: Kilometers.ai

## Implementation Status Overview

### üéØ Current Phase: Custom Domain & Launch
**Goal**: Configure custom domain (kilometers.ai) and launch the complete marketing-to-application flow.

**Status**: The marketing site infrastructure is deployed and functional. All technical components are complete and ready for production launch with custom domain.

## ‚úÖ What's Working Perfectly

### üèÜ Core System (FULLY AUTOMATED IN DEV)
- **End-to-End Environment**: The complete `dev` environment is live in Azure and managed by Terraform.
- **CLI Wrapper**: Complete Go implementation with transparent MCP server monitoring.
- **API Backend**: Full .NET 9 API with event ingestion, storage, and analytics is running.
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL is connected and has been successfully migrated.
- **Health Verification**: API is confirmed healthy via the `/health` endpoint.

### üèÜ CI/CD and Automation (COMPLETE)
- **Automated API Pipeline**: The API is automatically built and deployed on every push to `main`.
- **Automated Infrastructure Pipeline**: Infrastructure changes are automatically applied on every push to `main`.
- **Automated CLI Releases**: The CLI tool is automatically built and published to GitHub Releases on every push to `main`.
- **Marketing Site CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow deploys marketing site on every `marketing/**` change.

### üèÜ Marketing Site (DEPLOYED & FUNCTIONAL) ‚úÖ
- **Azure Static Web Apps**: Live at https://kind-meadow-0cc78e710.1.azurestaticapps.net
- **Next.js 15 Application**: Complete marketing site with modern React 19 and Tailwind CSS.
- **Clean Dependencies**: Removed unused packages (date-fns, react-day-picker) for conflict-free builds
- **Feature Flag System**: 14 environment variables controlling site behavior and features.
- **OAuth Flow Architecture**: Split authentication pattern with marketing site initiation and main app completion.
- **Automated Deployment**: GitHub Actions pipeline functional with path-based triggering.

### üèÜ Infrastructure as Code (COMPLETE)
- **Terraform Modules**: Modular infrastructure including Static Web Apps
- **Environment Management**: Separate dev/prod configurations with proper variable files
- **State Management**: Remote backend with proper state file management
- **Secret Management**: GitHub secrets automatically managed by Terraform
- **Targeted Deployments**: Learned to use targeted applies for safe infrastructure updates

## ‚ùå What's Not Implemented (Next Phase)

### Custom Domain Configuration (IMMEDIATE PRIORITY)
- **Marketing Domain**: Configure kilometers.ai CNAME for Static Web Apps
- **API Subdomain**: Set up app.kilometers.ai for API services
- **SSL Certificates**: Automatic certificate management and renewal
- **DNS Validation**: Verify domain ownership and routing

### Dashboard/Frontend (Phase 3)
- **React SPA**: Web dashboard for event visualization.
- **Real-time Updates**: Live event streaming via SignalR.
- **User Management**: Authentication and multi-tenant support.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Trend analysis and predictive insights.

### Production Environment Hardening
- **Production Workflow**: A separate, more controlled CI/CD workflow for deploying to the `prod` environment, including manual approvals.
- **Advanced Monitoring & Alerting**: Fine-tuned alerts for production-level issues.
- **Scaled Resources**: Higher-tier resources for the App Service and Database.

## üîß Critical Lessons Learned

### Terraform State Management
**Issue**: Resources existed in Azure with different names than Terraform state expected, causing plan to recreate everything.

**Root Cause**: When `random_id.suffix` changes, all dependent resources get new names. If state file has old suffix but Azure has resources with new suffix, Terraform thinks it needs to recreate everything.

**Solution**: 
1. Always run `terraform refresh` before major changes
2. Use targeted applies for new resources: `terraform apply -target=module.new_resource`
3. Import existing resources when state is out of sync
4. Verify Azure reality matches Terraform expectations

### Dependency Management
**Issue**: Azure Static Web Apps build failed due to conflicting peer dependencies.

**Root Cause**: `react-day-picker@8.10.1` required `date-fns@^2.28.0 || ^3.0.0` but project had `date-fns@4.1.0`.

**Solution**: Removed unused dependencies rather than using `--legacy-peer-deps` workaround. This resulted in cleaner, more maintainable codebase.

---

**üöÄ LAUNCH READY**: The complete technical stack is deployed and functional. Marketing site is live with clean architecture and automated deployment. The only remaining step is custom domain configuration for production launch.

**Key Achievement**: Successfully deployed Azure Static Web Apps with clean dependency management and learned critical Terraform state management patterns for future deployments.

**Timeline**: Targeting functional CLI within 1-2 weeks

## ✅ What's Working

### Project Foundation
- **Documentation System**: Complete Memory Bank established with all core files
- **Project Structure**: Well-organized codebase with clear separation of concerns
- **Technology Stack**: All technology decisions finalized and documented
- **Functional Specification**: Comprehensive 457-line specification covering all phases

### Core Implementation (COMPLETED)
- **CLI Wrapper**: Fully functional Go CLI that transparently wraps MCP servers
- **API Backend**: Complete .NET 9 API with event ingestion, storage, and retrieval
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL integration with EF Core migrations
- **CLI-API Integration**: End-to-end event capture and transmission working perfectly

### Basic Infrastructure
- **Repository Setup**: Git repository with proper .gitignore and structure
- **Go Module**: CLI module initialized with Go 1.24.4
- **.NET API**: Complete minimal API with event processing endpoints
- **Development Environment**: Local development setup documented and verified
- **Database Schema**: EF Core migration created and ready for deployment

## 🚧 What's In Progress

### Infrastructure Deployment (Priority 1)
- **Status**: All code complete, ready for cloud deployment
- **Next**: Azure resource definitions and deployment pipeline
- **Key Files**: `terraform/main.tf` (needs Azure resources), CI/CD setup

### Production Features (Priority 2)
- **Status**: Core functionality complete, enhancing for production
- **Next**: Authentication, monitoring, and advanced analytics
- **Key Files**: Authentication middleware, Application Insights integration

## ❌ What's Not Working Yet

### Production Infrastructure  
- **Azure Resources**: No cloud infrastructure provisioned yet
- **Production Database**: No production PostgreSQL instance running
- **Deployment Pipeline**: No CI/CD for automated deployments
- **Authentication**: No API key or JWT authentication system for production

### Advanced Features
- **Cross-Platform CLI Builds**: No automated build pipeline for Windows/macOS/Linux
- **Advanced Risk Analysis**: Basic risk scoring implemented, needs enhancement
- **Cost Tracking**: Basic cost calculation working, needs real AI model pricing
- **Performance Monitoring**: No application insights or advanced logging configured

### Dashboard/Frontend
- **React App**: No frontend implementation started
- **API Integration**: No dashboard querying API endpoints
- **Real-time Updates**: No live data feeds or polling
- **User Authentication**: No login or user management system

## 📋 Immediate Development Plan

### Week 1: CLI Foundation
**Goal**: Working CLI that can wrap MCP servers and capture basic events

#### Day 1-2: Core CLI Implementation
- [ ] Create `cli/main.go` with process wrapper logic
- [ ] Implement stdin/stdout monitoring for MCP protocol
- [ ] Basic event structure and JSON serialization
- [ ] Local file logging for initial testing

#### Day 3-4: API Communication
- [ ] HTTP client for posting events to API
- [ ] Basic authentication mechanism (API key)
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Configuration file support

#### Day 5-7: Testing & Polish
- [ ] Test with real MCP servers (GitHub, Slack)
- [ ] Cross-platform build scripts
- [ ] CLI help documentation and examples
- [ ] Performance measurement and optimization

### Week 2: API Foundation
**Goal**: API that can receive, process, and store events

#### Day 1-3: Core API Features
- [ ] Event ingestion endpoint (`POST /api/events`)
- [ ] Domain models for MCP events
- [ ] PostgreSQL database context and migrations
- [ ] Basic event storage and retrieval

#### Day 4-5: Processing Pipeline
- [ ] Background event processing service
- [ ] Basic risk analysis implementation
- [ ] Cost calculation logic
- [ ] Event aggregation for dashboard queries

#### Day 6-7: API Testing
- [ ] Integration with CLI for end-to-end testing
- [ ] Database schema optimization
- [ ] API performance testing
- [ ] Error handling and validation

### Week 3-4: Infrastructure & Dashboard
**Goal**: Deployed system with basic web interface

#### Infrastructure Deployment
- [ ] Terraform configuration for Azure resources
- [ ] PostgreSQL flexible server setup
- [ ] App Service configuration for API
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions

#### Basic Dashboard
- [ ] React SPA with activity feed
- [ ] API client for dashboard data
- [ ] Real-time polling for updates
- [ ] Basic user authentication

## 🔍 Quality Metrics

### Code Quality Targets
- **Test Coverage**: >80% for critical paths (CLI wrapper, API endpoints)
- **Performance**: <5ms overhead added by CLI wrapper
- **Reliability**: <0.1% error rate for event capture and transmission
- **Security**: All API endpoints authenticated, PII detection active

### User Experience Targets
- **Installation**: Single command setup in <30 seconds
- **First Value**: Dashboard showing data within 5 minutes of installation
- **Performance**: No noticeable impact on AI tool responsiveness
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for event collection

## 🐛 Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Current Limitations
- **No Implementation**: Core functionality not yet built
- **No Testing**: No automated tests for any component
- **No Documentation**: API endpoints not documented
- **No Monitoring**: No application insights or logging

### Technical Debt to Address
- **Error Handling**: Need comprehensive error handling strategy
- **Configuration**: Standardize configuration across CLI and API
- **Security**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
- **Performance**: Establish benchmarking and optimization processes

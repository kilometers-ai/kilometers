## Implementation Status Overview

### 🎯 Current Phase: CI/CD Automation
**Goal**: Automate the deployment process for infrastructure and application code using GitHub Actions.

**Status**: The `dev` environment is fully deployed and verified in Azure. The next step is to build the CI/CD pipeline to make this process repeatable and reliable.

## ✅ What's Working Perfectly

### 🏆 Core System (FULLY DEPLOYED IN DEV)
- **End-to-End Environment**: The complete `dev` environment is live in Azure.
- **CLI Wrapper**: Complete Go implementation with transparent MCP server monitoring.
- **API Backend**: Full .NET 9 API with event ingestion, storage, and analytics is running.
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL is connected and has been successfully migrated.
- **Health Verification**: API is confirmed healthy via the `/health` endpoint.

### 🏆 Production Infrastructure (DEPLOYMENT READY & DEV PROVEN)
- **Terraform Configuration**: The IaC setup has been battle-tested and successfully deployed a complete, working environment. All major issues (state, RBAC, networking) have been resolved.
- **Security Configuration**: Proper RBAC, TLS, and secret management are in place and verified.
- **Backend State Management**: Azure Storage for Terraform state is working as expected.

### 🏆 Application Features (DEPLOYED IN DEV)
- **Event Ingestion**: `/api/events` and `/api/events/batch` endpoints are live.
- **Health Monitoring**: `/health` endpoint is responding with a `200 OK`.
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL integration is operational.
- **Security**: Bearer token authentication and Azure Key Vault integration are configured and working.

## 🚀 Ready for Automation

### CI/CD Pipeline (Next Step)
The next major goal is to create a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the process we just completed manually. The pipeline will be responsible for:
- Building and testing the .NET API.
- Running `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` to manage infrastructure.
- Publishing the API application to the Azure App Service.

## ❌ What's Not Implemented (Future Phases)

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Automated Workflow**: The GitHub Actions workflow file needs to be created.
- **Secrets Management**: Securely storing Azure credentials in GitHub for the workflow to use.
- **Automated Testing**: Integrating unit and integration tests into the pipeline.
- **Production Deployment**: A separate, more controlled workflow for deploying to the `prod` environment.

### Dashboard/Frontend (Phase 3)
- **React SPA**: Web dashboard for event visualization.
- **Real-time Updates**: Live event streaming via SignalR.
- **User Management**: Authentication and multi-tenant support.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Trend analysis and predictive insights.

**🏁 READY FOR CI/CD**: The `dev` environment is stable and operational. The manual deployment process has been fully debugged. The project is now ready for automation.

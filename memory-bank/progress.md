# Progress: Kilometers.ai

## Implementation Status Overview

### 🎯 Current Phase: Foundation & CLI Development
**Goal**: Build working CLI wrapper that can monitor MCP interactions and send events to API

**Timeline**: Targeting functional CLI within 1-2 weeks

## ✅ What's Working

### Project Foundation
- **Documentation System**: Complete Memory Bank established with all core files
- **Project Structure**: Well-organized codebase with clear separation of concerns
- **Technology Stack**: All technology decisions finalized and documented
- **Functional Specification**: Comprehensive 457-line specification covering all phases

### Basic Infrastructure
- **Repository Setup**: Git repository with proper .gitignore and structure
- **Go Module**: CLI module initialized with Go 1.24.4
- **.NET API Scaffold**: Basic .NET 9 minimal API with working "Hello World" endpoint
- **Development Environment**: Local development setup documented and verified

## 🚧 What's In Progress

### CLI Implementation (Priority 1)
- **Status**: Module created, implementation needed
- **Next**: Core wrapper functionality in `main.go`
- **Key Files**: `cli/main.go` (not yet created)

### API Development (Priority 2)  
- **Status**: Basic scaffold exists, domain models needed
- **Current**: Minimal "Hello World" endpoint working
- **Next**: Event ingestion endpoint and data models
- **Key Files**: `api/Kilometers.Api/Program.cs` (basic), need domain layer

### Infrastructure Setup (Priority 3)
- **Status**: Terraform directory created but empty
- **Next**: Azure resource definitions in `main.tf`
- **Key Files**: `terraform/main.tf` (empty file)

## ❌ What's Not Working Yet

### CLI Core Functionality
- **Process Wrapping**: No MCP server wrapping implemented
- **Event Capture**: No MCP protocol parsing or event generation  
- **API Communication**: No HTTP client for sending events to API
- **Cross-Platform Build**: No build pipeline for multiple platforms

### API Backend
- **Event Ingestion**: No `/api/events` endpoint implemented
- **Data Models**: No domain models for MCP events
- **Database Integration**: No PostgreSQL connection or models
- **Authentication**: No API key or JWT authentication system

### Infrastructure  
- **Azure Resources**: No cloud infrastructure provisioned
- **Database**: No PostgreSQL instance running
- **Deployment Pipeline**: No CI/CD for automated deployments
- **Monitoring**: No logging or application insights configured

### Dashboard/Frontend
- **React App**: No frontend implementation started
- **API Integration**: No dashboard querying API endpoints
- **Real-time Updates**: No live data feeds or polling
- **User Authentication**: No login or user management system

## 📋 Immediate Development Plan

### Week 1: CLI Foundation
**Goal**: Working CLI that can wrap MCP servers and capture basic events

#### Day 1-2: Core CLI Implementation
- [ ] Create `cli/main.go` with process wrapper logic

- [ ] Cross-platform build scripts
- [ ] CLI help documentation and examples
- [ ] Performance measurement and optimization

### Week 2: API Foundation
**Goal**: API that can receive, process, and store events

#### Day 1-3: Core API Features
- [ ] Event ingestion endpoint (`POST /api/events`)
- [ ] Domain models for MCP events
- [ ] PostgreSQL database context and migrations
- [ ] Basic event storage and retrieval

#### Day 4-5: Processing Pipeline
- [ ] Background event processing service
- [ ] Basic risk analysis implementation
- [ ] Cost calculation logic
- [ ] Event aggregation for dashboard queries

#### Day 6-7: API Testing
- [ ] Integration with CLI for end-to-end testing
- [ ] Database schema optimization
- [ ] API performance testing
- [ ] Error handling and validation

### Week 3-4: Infrastructure & Dashboard
**Goal**: Deployed system with basic web interface

#### Infrastructure Deployment
- [ ] Terraform configuration for Azure resources
- [ ] PostgreSQL flexible server setup
- [ ] App Service configuration for API
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions

#### Basic Dashboard
- [ ] React SPA with activity feed
- [ ] API client for dashboard data
- [ ] Real-time polling for updates
- [ ] Basic user authentication

## 🔍 Quality Metrics

### Code Quality Targets
- **Test Coverage**: >80% for critical paths (CLI wrapper, API endpoints)
- **Performance**: <5ms overhead added by CLI wrapper
- **Reliability**: <0.1% error rate for event capture and transmission
- **Security**: All API endpoints authenticated, PII detection active

### User Experience Targets
- **Installation**: Single command setup in <30 seconds
- **First Value**: Dashboard showing data within 5 minutes of installation
- **Performance**: No noticeable impact on AI tool responsiveness
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for event collection

## 🐛 Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Current Limitations
- **No Implementation**: Core functionality not yet built
- **No Testing**: No automated tests for any component
- **No Documentation**: API endpoints not documented
- **No Monitoring**: No application insights or logging

### Technical Debt to Address

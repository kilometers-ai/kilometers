## Implementation Status Overview

### üéØ Current Phase: Go-to-Market & Launch
**Goal**: Acquire the first users and validate the product's value in a real-world setting.

**Status**: The core technical product is complete. The infrastructure and application are deployed and are now managed by a fully automated CI/CD pipeline.

## ‚úÖ What's Working Perfectly

### üèÜ Core System (FULLY AUTOMATED IN DEV)
- **End-to-End Environment**: The complete `dev` environment is live in Azure and managed by Terraform.
- **CLI Wrapper**: Complete Go implementation with transparent MCP server monitoring.
- **API Backend**: Full .NET 9 API with event ingestion, storage, and analytics is running.
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL is connected and has been successfully migrated.
- **Health Verification**: API is confirmed healthy via the `/health` endpoint.

### üèÜ CI/CD and Automation (COMPLETE)
- **Automated API Pipeline**: The API is automatically built and deployed on every push to `main`.
- **Automated Infrastructure Pipeline**: Infrastructure changes are automatically applied on every push to `main`.
- **Automated CLI Releases**: The CLI tool is automatically built and published to GitHub Releases on every push to `main`.
- **Marketing Site CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow for Azure Static Web Apps deployment ready for activation.

### üèÜ Marketing Site Integration (COMPLETE)
- **Next.js 15 Application**: Complete marketing site with modern React 19 and Tailwind CSS.

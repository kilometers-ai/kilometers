# Project Brief: Kilometers.ai

## Core Mission
Kilometers.ai monitors AI agent activity by wrapping MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, providing immediate visibility into AI tool usage, costs, and potential risks with a 30-second setup.

## Vision Statement
"Your AI's digital odometer" - Track every interaction, understand patterns, control costs, and ensure security across all AI agent activities.

## Key Value Propositions
1. **Instant Setup**: 30-second installation via CLI wrapper
2. **Universal Monitoring**: Works with any MCP server (GitHub, Slack, databases, etc.)
3. **Cost Transparency**: Real-time tracking of AI usage costs
4. **Risk Detection**: Identify unusual patterns and potential security issues
5. **Beautiful Dashboard**: Modern UI showing AI's "journey" through various tools

## Core Requirements

### Primary Goals
- Monitor all MCP server interactions transparently
- Track costs, performance, and usage patterns
- Provide actionable insights via web dashboard
- Ensure zero-friction installation and setup
- Scale from individual developers to enterprise teams

### Success Criteria
- **Day 1**: CLI wrapper functional for major MCP servers
- **Day 3**: Cloud backend operational with dashboard
- **Day 7**: 3 paying customers ($147 MRR)
- **Day 30**: 100 customers ($4,900 MRR)

## Technical Strategy
**Phase 1**: Go CLI wrapper that pipes MCP traffic
**Phase 2**: Azure-hosted .NET API for event processing
**Phase 3**: React dashboard for visualization
**Phase 4**: CI/CD and production deployment
**Phase 5**: Launch and scale

## Market Position
Targeting AI power users and organizations who need visibility into their AI agent ecosystem. Positioned as essential infrastructure for AI-powered workflows, similar to how APM tools are essential for web applications.

## Business Model
- **Free Tier**: 7-day data retention, basic monitoring
- **Pro Tier**: $49/month, 90-day retention, advanced analytics
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing, extended retention, SSO

## Project Constraints
- Must work transparently with existing MCP setups
- No modification required to existing AI tools
- Minimal performance overhead
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
